# Github Events Calendar

- [x] Fetch "call" issues from an orgs repo
- [x] Parse issue for event meta data
- [ ] Add all events to an ical event calendar 🤷‍♀️
- [ ] Create issue template standard proposal "new standards xkcd" and get all projects I follow to use it 😅 or build a custom parser if that's too contentious 🤦‍♀️
- [ ] Subscribe to calendar!!!!
- [ ] Profit? … Or just finally have alerts of all events happening in the bitcoin community and projects I follow!!
- [ ] … Hope no updates are made to the issue
